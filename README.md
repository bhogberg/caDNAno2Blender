# caDNAno2Blender
A module for drawing DNA nanostructures based on caDNAno-files in blender


# Installation

1. Create a folder 'caDNAno2Blender' where Blender looks for addons and put the file '__init__.py' in that folder

2. Start blender with elevated privileges (Run as administrator on Windows)

2. In Blender, 'Edit' -> 'Preferences' under 'Addons'
Search for caDNAno2Blender and make sure it is loaded. Expand the addon using its arrow. 

3. After loading the first time you will need to press "Install Dependencies" (still in the addons tab that was opened above). See fig below. (Depending on what addons you have previously installed for your blender installation, this step might not be needed.) 

4. Re-start blender after that, to get the addon to work. No need to run in administrator mode again (only necessary the first time to install python dependencies)

# Running

1. Open the tab next to the xyz gizmo.
2. Select the caDNAno2Blender-tab
3. Load a file
4. Select lattice
5. Produce models using the buttons.
Quirks: a) Will not find scaffold paths in circular models, breakpoints needed for every scaffold section. b) Circular staples will not be found and will not be drawn in spaghetti-models. c) Some designs generated by scripts have issues with the colors, spaghetti models will fail for these - temp solution: go in and set a color for all staples and re-save the file. d) There is some offset in twist angles in the spaghetti rendering that get worse in long (along the helical direction) designs, those designs look good in one end but crossovers in the other end will have the wrong angles. - Needs fixing.
