# caDNAno2Blender
 A module for handling caDNAno files in blender

Create a folder 'caDNAno2Blender' where Blender looks for addons and the file '__init__.py' in that folder

In Blender, 'Edit' -> 'Preferences' under 'Addons'
Search for caDNAno2Blender and make sure it is loaded. 

After loading the first time you will need to press "Install Dependencies" (or similar) still in the addons tab that was opened above. You might need to re-start blender after that, to get the addon to work. See fig below.
