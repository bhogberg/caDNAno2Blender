# caDNAno2Blender

# Installation
A module for handling caDNAno files in blender

1. Create a folder 'caDNAno2Blender' where Blender looks for addons and put the file '__init__.py' in that folder

2. Start blender with elevated privileges (Run as administrator on Windows)

2. In Blender, 'Edit' -> 'Preferences' under 'Addons'
Search for caDNAno2Blender and make sure it is loaded. Expand the addon using its arrow. 

3. After loading the first time you will need to press "Install Dependencies" (still in the addons tab that was opened above). See fig below.

4. Re-start blender after that, to get the addon to work. No need to run in administrator mode again (only necessary the first time to install python dependencies)
